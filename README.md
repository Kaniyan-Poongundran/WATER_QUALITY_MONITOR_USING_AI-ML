# WATER_QUALITY_MONITOR_USING_AI-ML
This project monitors water quality ðŸŒŠ by using sensors connected to an ESP32 to measure physical parameters like pH, turbidity, and temperature. AI/ML models analyze the data to classify water as Safe ðŸ¦º or Unsafe ðŸ’€ for drinking. A Streamlit dashboard provides real-time visualization, trends, and safety updates.
